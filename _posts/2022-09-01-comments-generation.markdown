## Why

When I just started this blog little thought came to my mind : "How on earth I will interract with readers!?".

here is some sample code

```javascript
// After 2 seconds, reset the button to its initial UI
setTimeout(() => {
  copyCodeButton.innerText = originalText;
  copyCodeButton.classList.remove("copied");
}, 2000);
```

```python
import re
print("some")

```
