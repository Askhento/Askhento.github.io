Hi this is some test scene with ThreeJS library.

I know it is a little bit distracting and I will not use it everywhere but still I dand a lot fun making it!

```javascript
console.log("Help!");

import * as THREE from "/assets/scripts/three.js";

var scene, renderer, camera, controls, cube;
```

{% include birds.html %}
